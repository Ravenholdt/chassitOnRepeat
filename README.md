# Chassit on Repeat
### The better and more simple ListenOnRepeat

This is a website for looping video with optional start/end times and tracking the amount of loops.

#### Getting started
Copy the `.env.example` file and rename to `.env`, 
in this file you write your MongoDB credentials to connect the site to your database.

You need to have php7 and composer installed to run. Afterwards you need to install the dependencies by using the following command:
```bash
composer install 
# you may need to pass which php version if you have multiple php versions installed
```

Afterwards you can use a web server like Apache to run it!
